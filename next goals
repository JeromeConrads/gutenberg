use td-idf to get keywords
implement using dask:
https://github.com/dask/dask-ml/issues/744

use spacy to plot all keywords on a graph


take 1 genre use kmeans to cluster all keywords of that genre
repeat for all genre

use test data: find keywords and look what centroid is the closest to them
thats the prediction


tf idf save steps in files
1. total corpus counts will contain
word total_count Document_frequency

2. calculate for each PG the tf-idf
word count_inpg tf-idf
