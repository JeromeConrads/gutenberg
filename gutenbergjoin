what i have
1. list containing all words
2. multiple Pgs containing some words and tf-idf of each word and Pg names
3. metadata showing all Pgs

all words
The a k

PG1:
The a
1 2

PG2:
k
5

PG3:
The a
3 4

what i want
1 sparse matrix
1 axis all words
2nd axis all counts of that word in each PG

The a k
1 2 0	PG1
0 0 5	PG2
3 4 0	PG3


solution
loop eahc PG and left join them on "word"
Problem: may be to large
may be to slow
loses Dask properties
then transform into sparse matrix
